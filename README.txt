Development Steps


Step 1: Requirement Analysis
Identify detailed user requirements, including KCSE integration, preferred career clusters, and application workflows.

Step 2: Design
Create wireframes and design the system architecture, focusing on the backend integration with KNEC,
 the AI recommendation model, and Firebase for authentication and storage.

Step 3: Data Collection
Use publicly available KUCCPS data for career clusters and admission requirements.
Collect additional datasets, such as job trends and success stories, for the AI model.


Step 4: Backend Development
Python: Develop AI models for career recommendations, leveraging libraries like TensorFlow and Scikit-learn.
MySQL: Set up a relational database for user data, KCSE performance, and career options.


Step 5: Frontend Development
Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive and interactive user interface.
Implement dashboards for students, parents, and mentors.


Step 6: Testing
Conduct usability testing with actual high school students to ensure the system meets their needs.


Step 7: Deployment
Host the application on a scalable cloud service and provide mobile app access for better reach.


Step 8: Maintenance
Continuously update the recommendation algorithms and career content based on changing trends.
